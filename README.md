# CreditCard
The aim of this project is to estimate tree based models to detect credit card fraud from a large transaction dataset. Specifically, a random forest model and gradient boosting machine will be compared for performance across different hyperparameters.
Adaptive cross-validation will be used to generate different hyperparameters across 4 CV-folds. The maximum number of hyperparameters tested is 20 because of hardware restrictions.
All the code can be found in the R model script: "Treemodel_and_Evaluation"
